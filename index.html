        <h1>Sylvia &colon; <em>A Journey</em></h1>
            <span class = "subhead">On October 8, 2016, I adopted my daughter.
            This is our road so far.</span>

        <h2>Our First Day</h2>
        <img src="images/yelling.jpg" />
            <p>Sylvia is a three-year-old dilute tricolor kitten. She was brought into the Humane Society of St. Louis City as a stray. The shelter staff estimated she was around three years old. She was so tiny it almost scared me.</p>
            <p>I quickly found out that Sylvia really hates car rides. After we got home and I let her out of her temporary carrying box, she jumped up on the table and voiced her displeasure. She was perfect.</p>

        <div id="section">
            <h2>Majesty</h2>
        <img src="images/majesty.jpg" /> <img src="images/tall.jpg" />
            <p>It didn't take long for Sylvia to make herself at home. Everywhere. I'm pretty sure the apartment belongs to her now. I'm just a guest here, only welcome when bearing tuna cat food or feathery toys - which she promptly rips apart.</p>

            <h2>Some Of Her Favorite Things</h2>
            <div id="subsection">
                <h3>Destroying Blinds</h3>
                <img src="images/window.jpg" />
                <p>My girl is named for Sylvia Plath, and I like to think she's got something of a poet's soul when she tears holes in my blinds and stares into the cold alleyway behind my apartment.</p>
                <p>She's probably just interested in the outdoor cat who lives next door.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="subsection">
                <h3>The West Wing</h3>
                <img src="images/tww.jpg" />
                <p>She likes CJ. She has good taste.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="subsection">
                <h3>Modeling</h3>
                <img src="images/modelface.jpg" /> <img src="images/beautyface.jpg" />
                <p>She is the most handsome.</p>

            <h2>In Conclusion...</h2>
            <img src="images/cute.jpg" />
            <p>Sylvia is Best Cat and I couldn't be happier that she's with me. Even when she's waking me up at five a.m., and when her breath smells like fish, and when she decides my feet are vermin that must die.</p>
            <img src="images/love.jpg" />
            <p>And I'm fairly certain she'd vote me Best, too.<p>
