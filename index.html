        <h1>Sylvia</h1>
        <p>On October 8, 2016, I adopted my daughter: a three-year-old dilute tri-color kitten. This is our journey so far.</p>

        <h2>Our First Day</h2>

        <article>
            <p>Sylvia really hates car rides. After we got home and I let her out of her temporary carrying box, she jumped up on the table and voiced her displeasure. She was perfect.</p>

        <h2>Majesty</h2>

        <article>
            <p>It didn't take long for Sylvia to make herself at home. Everywhere. I'm pretty sure the apartment belongs to her now. I'm just the (occasionally unwelcome) guest.</p>

        <h2>Some Of Her Favorite Things</h2>
        <h3>Destroying Blinds</h3>
        <img src="images/window.jpg" />
        <article>
            <p>There's an outdoor cat who lives next door and comes into our yard a lot. Sylvia's probably just interested in the cat, but I like to think she's watching me, too.</p>

        <h3>The West Wing</h3>

        <article>
            <p>She likes CJ. She has good taste.</p>

        <h3>Modeling</h3>

        <article>
            <p>She is the most handsome.</p>
        </article>
        <h2>In Conclusion...</h2>
        <img src="images/cute.jpg" />
        <article>
            <p>Sylvia is Best Cat and I couldn't be happier that she's with me. Even when she's waking me up at five a.m., and when her breath smells like fish, and when she decides my feet are vermin that must die.</p>

        <img src="images/love.jpg" />
        <article>
            <p>And I'm fairly certain she'd vote me Best, too.<p>
